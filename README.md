# Jabodetabek Property Analysis

This project aims to **provide insight into the conditions of the property market in Jabodetabek**. The data used are the results of a quick sample of Â± 10,000 houses offered on one of the marketplace sites in Indonesia in September 2020. The values shown do not necessarily represent the actual prices. This project is modified from Geospatial Analysis in R workshop by Algoritma Data Science School.
  
The final result of this project is a simple Jabodetabek housing dashboard which can be seen [here](https://rpubs.com/godfriedjunio/jakartapropertydashboard). It looks like this:
